## Description
- the cryptography section contains 1 lab


## Cryptography Section

### Lab 1 - simple symmetric ciphers

<b> Task 1: </b>
create your own transposition cipher, implement it in any programming language, encrypt a given message using your cipher, and then decrypt it. Describe the advantages and disadvantages of your cipher.

<b> Task 2: </b>
design a simple substitution cipher (monoalphabetic cipher), implement it in any programming language, encrypt a given message using your cipher, and then decrypt it.

<b> Task 3: </b>
develop a single-character substitution cipher, implement it in any programming language, encrypt a given message using your cipher, and then decrypt it. Describe the advantages and disadvantages of your cipher.

<b> Task 4: </b>
create a polygram substitution cipher, implement it in any programming language, encrypt a given message using your cipher, and then decrypt it. Describe the advantages and disadvantages of your cipher.

<b> Task 5: </b>
design a polyalphabetic substitution cipher, implement it in any programming language, encrypt a given message using your cipher, and then decrypt it. Describe the advantages and disadvantages of your cipher.

<b> Task 6: </b>
given that the message "Pbatenghyngvbaf! Vg'f n Pnrfne pvcure!" was encrypted using a Caesar cipher with an unknown key k, write a helper program to assist in decrypting this message.

<b> Task 7: </b>
implement your own version of the ROT13 function in any programming language, encrypt a given message using your cipher, and then decrypt it. Describe the advantages and disadvantages of your cipher.
